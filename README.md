# Booking-Doctors-Appointment
End-to-End Supervisor Multi-Agentic AI Project

Doctor Appointment System: Using LangGraph, FastAPI, and Streamlit

In this project we have built a AI powered Multiagent Doctor's appointment booking system that simulates a realistic medical assistant capable of handeling user quaries regarding doctor availability, specialization and finally booking an appointment.

Tech Stack uses:
Langchain: For LLM model loading, prompt creation and Tools
Langgraph: For Agentic Workflow creation
FastAPI: For serving the API endpoint/execution
Streamlit: For frontend 
Python-pandas: For data handling


Sample example:
User: Can you check if a dermatologist is avaialble on 15th of Aug at 10:00PM?
Agent: Dr. Dristanta(Dermatologist) is avaialbe on 15th Aug at 10:00AM. Do you want to book an appointment with her?
